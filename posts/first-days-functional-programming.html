No side effects, no modifying global state, no printing to console inside your function. If your function does anything other than transform input to output, it&#39;s not pure. This sounds too extreme... because what meaningful program can you build without all the side effect. No write database or any files and etc..</p><p>Apparently you can, but unlike <code>console.log(&quot;hello, world)&quot;</code>, side effects are more advanced concept in functional programming. Haven&#39;t got to that part yet.</p><div class="post-heading h2-title"><a class="clip" href="#in-functional-programming-everything-is-immutable" id="in-functional-programming-everything-is-immutable">🔗</a><h2>In Functional Programming, Everything is Immutable</h2></div><p>An impure functional language generally doesn&#39;t allow rewriting memory, but still allows I/O, random numbers, and messaging other threads. But the core data structures are immutable. - like <a href="https://gleam.run/frequently-asked-questions/">Gleam</a>.</p><p>Why immutability? It actually comes with huge optimizations. It makes it easier for things like memoization and compiler-level optimizations.</p><div class="post-heading h2-title"><a class="clip" href="#no-loops" id="no-loops">🔗</a><h2>No Loops</h2></div><p>Immutability means no loops. for-loops and while-loops don&#39;t work, so all looping is done with recursion.</p></main></article></div></body></html>
