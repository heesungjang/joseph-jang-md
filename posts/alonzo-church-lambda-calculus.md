## What is Lambda Calculus?

Lambda calculus is a mathematical model for understanding computation. Despite its intimidating name, it's built on just three simple rules that can express any computable function.

Lambda calculus has had a huge influence on functional programming languages like OCaml and Haskell. Understanding these basic rules helps explain why functional languages work the way they do.

## The Three Rules of Lambda Calculus

### 1. Variables

You can use variables like x, y, z to represent values.

### 2. Abstraction

The λ (lambda) symbol lets you define something as a function. In lambda calculus, functions are the only basic data type.

The basic form is: `λ parameter.return`

So `λx.x` represents the function f(x) = x, and `λx.λy.x` represents a function f(x, y) = x.

Lambda calculus uses a concept from mathematics called currying. Functional programming languages like OCaml have currying built in.

Currying is a method that breaks down functions that take multiple arguments into a chain of functions that each take only one argument. This makes functions easier to reuse by calling them repeatedly.

Instead of taking two arguments at once like `λ(x,y).x y`, lambda calculus uses the form `λx.λy.x y`.

### 3. Application

An expression wrapped with λ is a function. To use that function, you apply a value to it:

```
λx.λy.x y
= f(x, y) = x
= x(y)
```

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
(λx.x) y
=> f(x) = x
=> x(y)
```

**Example 2:**

```
(λx.(λy.x)) z
=> f(x) = λy.x
=> λy.z
```

**Example 3:**

```
(λx.(λy.x y)) (λx.x) (z)
=> z
```

## The Big Problem

To use lambda calculus in programming languages, you need to handle basic data types like String, int, and Bool.

This problem was solved by American mathematician Alonzo Church (1903-1995). He invented Church Encoding to apply lambda numbers to Lambda Calculus.

## Church Encoding

Church Encoding is a formalized way of modeling data and functions.

### Church-encoded Boolean Values

Uses two arguments: returns the left argument when true, returns the right argument when false.

```
true = λa.λb.a   // if true, select parameter a
false = λa.λb.b  // if false, select parameter b
```

### Church-encoded Natural Numbers

```
pred(n) = (n=0) ? 0 : n-1
```

Church encoding extends to other types like Maybe, Either, and more complex data structures, providing a way to represent any data type using only functions.

## Why This Matters

Lambda calculus proves that computation can be reduced to simple function application. Every programming concept you use today can be expressed using just these three rules. It's the mathematical foundation that makes functional programming possible.
